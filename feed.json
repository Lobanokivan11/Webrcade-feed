Brave snowdrifts on ice-covered mountains, catch air off huge sand dunes in the desert, or careen around corners in the European countryside. Intensify the action by linking with 3 friends and going head-to-head in a 4-player race to the finish.",

The simulation starts you on an entire racing career beginning with a cheap used car and second-rate tracks. You will find yourself longing for the Dodge Viper as your sad $10,000 starting fund puts you behind the wheel of a used Honda Prelude or Mazda RX-7. As you win races, acquire money, and earn advanced licenses, you are able to buy better cars and race in more competitive matches right up to the GT World Cup.\n\nFeatures more than 140 cars.",
